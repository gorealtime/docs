.. _getting started:

Getting Started
================

Your first application
-----------------------

Before you're able to do anything on gorealtime you must
create an application. This is a straightforward
process so this guide won't cover it in detail.

First you'll need to register a user account `here
<https://preview.gorealtime.io/account/register>`_. Once
that's done you're able to create an application on
the `new application <https://preview.gorealtime.io/applications/new>`_
page.

After creating your application you'll be taken to the
application dashboard. There's not much you can do there at
present, but that'll change shortly. For now all we need
is the application key & secret anyway.

.. warning::
    Your application secret must absolutely always remain secret.
    Compromised secrets can be regenerated on the application dashboard.


Libraries
----------

A handful of language libraries are available for use
and can be found `on GitHub <https://github.com/gorealtime>`_.

Please refer to the specific library documentation if you
choose to use one.

If you're unable to find a library that takes your fancy why not
write one using the :ref:`API documentation <api latest>`
